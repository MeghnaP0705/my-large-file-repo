# Vehicle Detection and Class Wise Counting System using YOLO v7

This project focuses on detecting and counting vehicles from CCTV footage across various regions in Bengaluru. The objective is to classify vehicles by type (e.g. Bicycle, Bus, Cars, Two-wheelers, Three-wheelers, LCV, Person, Truck) and predict vehicle counts for the next 30 minutes based on historical data.

## **Step-by-Step Instructions to create the Docker File**

### **Prerequisites**
Ensure Docker is installed on your machine. You can follow the Docker installation guide for your operating system.


### **Building the Docker Image**

1. Cloning the repository

`git clone https://github.com/NehaJimmy/EmobilityHackathon.git
cd EmobilityHackathon`

2. Build the docker image
   
`docker build -t emobility-hackathon` 


### **Running the Docker Container**

`docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/app emobility-hackathon`

## **Names and descriptions of the various notebooks used**
**1. Yolov7_custom_Training.ipynb**

The training data file referenced in the code is used to train the YOLOv7 model for vehicle detection and counting. It contains labeled images of vehicles done with the help of Roboflow, which the model uses to learn how to identify and count various vehicle classes in new images or video streams, optimizing for real-time traffic analysis.

**2. directory_and_yaml_file_creation.ipynb**

This notebook likely contains code for organizing the dataset into the required directory structure for YOLOv7 and generating the `data.yaml` file. It helps ensure that the data is in the correct format for training.

**3. data.yaml**

The `data.yaml` file you provided seems to describe a dataset used for a machine learning project, likely for object detection or classification. Here's a short description:

- **names**: This list defines the categories or classes for the dataset. They include various types of vehicles (Bicycle, Bus, Car, LCV, Three Wheeler, Truck, TwoWheeler) and a general category for individuals (Person).

- **nc**: The number of classes in the dataset, which is 10. This includes the 7 vehicle types and the 'Person' class.

- **test**: The path to the directory containing test images, located at `/content/custom_dataset/test/images`.

- **train**: The path to the directory containing training images, located at `/content/custom_dataset/train/images`.

- **val**: The path to the directory containing validation images, located at `/content/custom_dataset/val/images`.

This setup is typically used for organizing data into different sets for training, validating, and testing a model.

**4. latest.pt**

The `latest.pt` file generated by YOLOv7 after implementing the specified `data.yaml` file contains the trained model weights and configuration. This file represents the modelâ€™s parameters learned during training on the dataset specified in the `data.yaml`. The dataset consists of images categorized into 7 classes, including various vehicle types and a 'Person' class. The model was trained using images from the designated training set, validated with the validation set, and evaluated with the test set.

**5. .gitattributes**

The .gitattributes file configuration you provided specifies how certain file types are handled by Git. Here's a short explanation:

- **pt filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text**: This line configures Git to use Git LFS (Large File Storage) for files with the .pt extension. filter=lfs tells Git to use LFS to manage these files, diff=lfs and merge=lfs specify that diffs and merges for these files should also use LFS, and -text indicates that Git should not perform any text-related processing (like line-ending conversions) on these files.

- **.mp4 filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text**: Similar to the .pt configuration, this line sets up Git to use LFS for files with the .mp4 extension. It handles these files with LFS for storage and management, and excludes text processing.

**6. README.md**

This is the placeholder for the README file that usually contains detailed instructions on how to set up, run, and contribute to the project.

## **Requirements.txt**

A requirements.txt file includes the necessary libraries for vehicle detection and counting using YOLOv7, Roboflow, centroid tracking, time series prediction with Prophet, and data storage using CSV or JSON files. It also covers dependencies for Docker.
